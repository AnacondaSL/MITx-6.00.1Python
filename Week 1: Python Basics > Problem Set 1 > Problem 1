Problem 1
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:

Number of vowels: 5

count=0
for n in s:
    if n=='a' or n=='e' or n=='i' or n=='o' or n=='u':
       count+=1
print("Number of vowels: "+str(count))
